My goal in creating Punt was to demonstrate the incredible possibilities of AGI through a comprehensive, multi-layered approach to robotic intelligence. Each iteration of the code represents a progressive exploration of life. 
The Punt project is more than code - it's a blueprint for potential AGI development, showcasing how intelligent systems might evolve to become more sophisticated, empathetic, and capable. Hope you like it
